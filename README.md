# QMRI
This toolbox enables multi-parameter mapping via the variable flip angle (VFA) technique
To learn how to use, read the user-guide: MPM Toolbox User Guide.pdf
You need Matlab (tested on Matlab 2016b) installed with ~8GB or RAM. If you set the calibration mode to "manual" 
you do not need the curve-fitting toolbox. A sample phantom dataset is available for download at https://www.dropbox.com/sh/355bbuom2zt0qho/AACphqU1UkOk_IEcrt_0vfUia?dl=0, which you can use to test the toolbox. For additional instructions, refer to the user guide.
